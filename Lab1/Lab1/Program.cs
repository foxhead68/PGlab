    // make sure Lab1 is the "Startup Project" (the name, Lab1, should be bold in Solution Explorer)

    //------------To run your lecture code-------------
    // right-click the LectureCode project and select "Set as startup project"
    //      NOTE: the lecture code is NOT required for turning in the lab.
    //      Each lab solution has a LectureCode project in it.That is provided for you to use
    //      if you want to follow along with the lecture videos.
    //      Also, it's a way to make that code easier to find when you're working on the lab.
    //      The lecture code is not required. It is highly recommended that you do the lecture challenges
    //      but that code won't be graded or reviewed.

    //
    //------------Lab Notes-------------
    //      Add your Read methods to the Input.cs file in the PG2Input project.
    //      Add any other methods in this file.
    //      Add the menu code to the Main method.
